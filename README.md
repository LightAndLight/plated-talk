This talk introduces the concept of property-based testing,
and explains how to write property tests using 'Hedgehog' -
a Haskell property testing library. 'QuickCheck' has been
seen as the standard for property-based testing solution for
over 15 years, but that is due to change as Hedgehog has improved
on all of QuickCheck's pain points.

Knowledge of Haskell and functional concepts up to the level of
monad transformers are assumed for the code example, but
the principles apply across all languages and paradigms.
